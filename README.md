## 🧪 Testing

This project includes comprehensive testing across both **end-to-end (E2E) functionality** and **automated UI workflows** using **Mocha**, **Chai**, and **Cypress**.

---

### ✅ End-to-End Testing with Mocha & Chai

Mocha and Chai were used to validate the complete backend and controller logic.

These tools support behavior-driven development (BDD) and allow writing structured test suites to verify business logic, route responses, and controller operations. The tests were run in a Node.js environment and covered all core user scenarios like registration, login, and form submission, ensuring accurate backend behavior and security handling.

#### 🧪 Test Coverage:

- ✅ User Authentication (Signup, Login)
- ✅ Admin Order Management
- ✅ Checkout Form Submissions
- ✅ Controller and Route Handling

- ✅ resetInactivityTimeout() – Verifies inactivity timer reset behavior
- ✅ authController – Tests for rendering login/signup views and sendOtp function
- ✅ cartController – Ensures getCart is defined and behaves as expected
- ✅ chatbotController – Confirms handleChat is a valid function
- ✅ Database Utility – Mocks and validates mongoose.connect() call

---

### ✅ Automated UI Testing with Cypress

Cypress was used to implement automated front-end testing to simulate real user interactions in a browser environment.

Cypress is a next-generation testing tool built specifically for modern web applications. It runs directly in the browser, allowing full control over the DOM, network requests, and browser behavior. For this project, Cypress was used to validate UI workflows such as navigating the site, signing up, logging in, viewing products, completing a checkout, and interacting with the chatbot. Its real-time reloading, time-travel debugging, and in-browser test runner made it ideal for verifying the user experience in a dynamic web interface.

#### 🧪 Test Coverage:

- ✅ Home Page Load & Navigation
- ✅ Signup and Login Flow
- ✅ Product Browsing and Shop Page
- ✅ Checkout Process Validation
- ✅ Admin Dashboard Access
- ✅ Chatbot Interaction Testing (LaceBot)
  



## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

To run the LaceVista application locally, a few simple setup steps are required. These ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed, the application is properly configured, and the development server is running.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone <https://github.com/Jaykumar677/LaceVista.git>

for this application. 
1. Build the Docker Image Make sure you're in the root directory of the project (where the Dockerfile 
is located), then run: 
    docker build -t sit725-app . 

 2. Run the Container Option A: Using Docker Compose 
If you're using docker-compose.yml, simply run: 
 docker-compose up 
Option B: Manually 
If you're running MongoDB locally or on Atlas, use: 
docker run --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 sit725-app 
Or your MongoDB Atlas URI mongodb+srv://ishikamandal0310:YtHFXjuQEbiqN7CU@cluster0.vv1gbjz.mongodb.net/LaceVista-Ishika

http://localhost:3000 

 4. Check the /api/student Route : 
http://localhost:3000/api/student
